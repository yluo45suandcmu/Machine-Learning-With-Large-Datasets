# Linear Regression on the Million Song Dataset

## Project Summary

This section covers a common supervised learning pipeline, using a subset of the Million Song Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Our goal is to train a linear regression model to predict the release year of a song given a set of audio features.
In this section, I will be implementing a common supervised learning pipeline, using a subset of the Million Song Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, to train a linear regression model to predict the release year of a song given a set of audio features.
In this part, we will cover:

- Part 1: Reading and parsing the Million Song dataset
- Part 2: Creating and evaluating a baseline model
- Part 3: Training (via gradient descent) and evaluating a linear regression model
- Part 4: Training using SparkML and tune hyperparameters via grid search
- Part 5: Adding interactions between features
See the notebook for detailed descriptions and instructions of each question.
