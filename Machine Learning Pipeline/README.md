# Machine Learning Pipeline

## Project Summary

we will work through a minimal machine learning pipeline. The steps include understanding the problem to obtaining a machine learning model. We break this down into 7 parts: 

- Part 1 – Business Understanding: The first step is to understand the problem we are trying to solve. This could involve conversations with stakeholders as well as readings describing the problem at hand.
- Part 2 – Data Extract-Transform-Load: We need to take the raw data we are given and make it usable for machine learning purposes, potentially pulling it from multiple sources.
- Part 3 – Explore Your Data: In this part we use SQL embedded in notebooks to take a look at the underlying database containing the data.
- Part 4 – Visualize Your Data: In this section, we use the notebook to create a few visualizations of the data we have.
- Part 5 – Data Preparation: We have to group up the relevant variables we want to actually use in our model.
- Part 6 – Data Modeling: Create a machine learning model and train it.
- Part 7 – Tuning and Evaluation: Try out different hyperparameter settings and different model types.
